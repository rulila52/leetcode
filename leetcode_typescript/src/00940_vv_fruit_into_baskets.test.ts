// Given the integer array fruits, return the maximum number of fruits you can pick.
// fruits[i] is the type of fruit the ith tree produces.
// Some strict rules that you must follow:
// - You only have two baskets, and each basket can only hold a single type of fruit.
// - Starting from any tree, you must pick exactly one fruit from every tree while moving to the right.
// - Once you reach a tree with fruit that cannot fit in your baskets, you must stop.
