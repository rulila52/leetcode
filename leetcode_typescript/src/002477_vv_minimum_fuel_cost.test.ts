// âœ…âœ… 2477. Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital (ðŸ¥³) (Accepted - by myself)
// ðŸ“… 12.02.23 (Daily Challenge)
// There is a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) structure.
// The capital city is city 0. You are given a 2D integer array roads where roads[i] = [ai, bi]
// denotes that there exists a bidirectional road connecting cities ai and bi.
// There is a meeting for the representatives of each city. The meeting is in the capital city.
// There is a car in each city. You are given an integer number of seats in each car.
// A representative can use the car in their city to travel or ride with another representative.
// The cost of traveling between two cities is one liter of fuel.
// Return the minimum number of liters of fuel to reach the capital city.
